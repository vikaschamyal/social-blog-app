Good request.
I’ll **rewrite this to sound human, calm, and builder-written**, not AI-marketing.
I’ll also **remove emojis/icons**, reduce hype words, and make it read like a **real GitHub README by a developer**.

## ChatLog – Social Media & Real-Time Chat Platform

ChatLog is a social media frontend built with **React (CRA)** and **Material UI**, inspired by modern platforms like Facebook.
The goal of this project is to explore how large social platforms are structured on the frontend while keeping the codebase clean, modular, and scalable.

The application focuses on **real-time communication, media sharing, and user interaction**, with an emphasis on practical UI patterns and production-style architecture.
